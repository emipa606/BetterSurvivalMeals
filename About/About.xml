Update of Agracores mod 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1716979038

- Added 4x recipies for fine and lavish survival meal
- Replaced the old xml-defs with patching to avoid overwrite vanilla definitions for meal and stoves
- Added stack-version of the meal-icon, the same as vanilla behaviour
- Removed the extra thought-definitions since they were identical to the normal "ate fine/lavish meal" in terms of values
- If ideology is loaded there are also vegetarian and carnivore variants
- Updated the graphics to make them more distinct
